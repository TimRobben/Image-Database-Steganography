# Thesis A Steganographic Database

This repository contains all code needed for creating an image steganography database in the frequency domain, as part of a Bachelor Thesis called A Steganographic Database. 

# Labels
Labels of the database of all the images can be found at https://github.com/cilevanmarken/Image-Steganograpy-Database together with the code to create the labels. This is because all code has been made together with Cile van Marken. 

# Methods
The following methods have been used and can be found at /methods:
